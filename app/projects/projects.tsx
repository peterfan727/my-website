    I engineered a GPT chatbot that can answer questions about myself. 
    Through this hobby project, I learned how to use OpenAI's API and the Langchain framework to create a vectorized knowledge base (KB), host the vectorized KB on a vector database, and query the database using a Conversational Q&A Chain. It was a fun project that taught me a lot about the challenges in prompt engineering and the importance of a good knowledge base using structured data.
